# OAC-Project
My project about ocean awareness is a website. I chose to make a website because I have been learning how to make them for two years.

I think that climate change is horrendous and could damage our society badly. Since the icebergs are melting from global warming, the cities near seas and oceans could all get consumed by the rising sea levels. 

I am trying to bring notice to the threats ocean is facing. If we do not care about our ocean, we could lose many species of fish, coral, and other sea animals. I want to tell people that there are little things they can do to help the ocean.

Things you could do to help the ocean; You can clean up the beaches from trash, follow "catch and release" practices and keep more fish alive. There are many other ways to help the ocean, and they are in my project!

We are all in this together; even though you are just a citizen, you should do the little things necessary to save our ocean. When we all make the right decision, it will add to a successful result!
